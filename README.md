# Python Snake Game

Welcome to the Python Snake Game repository. This game is a classic implementation of the popular Snake game, built in Python with the use of the turtle graphics module.

## Game Files

This repository contains the following python files:

1. `main.py`: This is the entry point of the game. It integrates all other modules and runs the game.

2. `snake.py`: This file contains the `Snake` class which is responsible for creating the snake, controlling its movement, and handling the growth of the snake when it consumes food.

3. `food.py`: This file contains the `Food` class, responsible for the creation and random placement of food items on the game screen.

4. `scoreboard.py`: This file contains the `Scoreboard` class, responsible for displaying and updating the game score.

## How to Play

- Clone this repository to your local machine.
- Navigate to the directory of the game.
- Run `python main.py` to start the game.
- Use the arrow keys to control the movement of the snake.
- The aim is to eat as much food as possible. Each time the snake eats food, it grows longer and the score increases.
- The game ends if the snake touches the game boundary or its own body.

## Prerequisites

- This game requires Python 3. Python can be downloaded from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
- The game uses the `turtle` module for graphics, which comes pre-installed with Python.
